Description: Package provides functions for estimating Bayesian quantile regression with ordinal outcomes, 
        computing the covariate effects, model comparison measures, and inefficiency factor. The generic 
        ordinal model with 3 or more outcomes (labeled OR1 model) is estimated by a combination of Gibbs 
        sampling and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Whereas an ordinal model with exactly 3 outcomes 
        (labeled OR2 model) is estimated using Gibbs sampling only. For each model framework, there is a 
        specific function for estimation. The summary output produces estimates for regression quantiles 
        and two measures of model comparison — log of marginal likelihood and Deviance Information Criterion 
        (DIC). The package also has specific functions for computing the covariate effects and other functions 
        that aids either the estimation or inference in quantile ordinal models.
