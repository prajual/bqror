\description{
Data containing 500 observations generated from the quantile
ordinal model with 4 outcomes and \eqn{p = 0.75} (i.e., 75th quantile)
}
\details{
This data contains 500 observations generated from the quantile
ordinal model with more than 3 outcomes at the 75th quantile (i.e., \eqn{p = 0.75}).
The model specifications for generating the data are as follows: \eqn{\beta = (-4, 5, 6)}, $X ~ Unif(0, 1)$, and
\eqn{\epsilon} ~ AL(\eqn{0, \sigma = 1, p = 0.75}).

The errors are generated from the asymmetric Laplace distribution
using the normal exponential mixture formulation. The cut-points \eqn{(0, 2, 4)}
are used to categorize the continuous values into 4 ordinal outcomes.
